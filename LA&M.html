  <div class="Intro">
    <p class="introtext">The best investments are businesses that have moats. An example being social media companies like Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat creating platforms that become more valuable the more people that use it. In my personal
      opinion the more superior moat are luxury brands and art. They benefit from age, where social media companies have not, allow for huge margins, and if executed correctly are just hard enough to get your hands on that it drives desire for the
      product even more. This is usually done through price or the number of products made. Because the luxury industry is so consolidated, below I will have lists of products that do the best job of being creative, innovative, and timeless. Some of
      these are available to purchase per share through apps like Rally Rd. As much as I love companies like Apple and Tesla they will not be on my list. Both of these companies offer products with prominent design and innovative technology but they
      would not be able to sell a product they release today in 20 years. Part of their business models is to bring great design and technology to the mass market. As CEO of LVMH group Bernard Arnolt has stated 1. "Affordable Luxury- these are two
      words that don't go together" 2. "A good product can last forever"</p>
