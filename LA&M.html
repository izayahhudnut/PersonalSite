  <p>The best investments are businesses that have moats. The most popular moat in the 21 century has been network effects. An example being social media companies like Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat creating platforms that become more valueable the more people that use it. In my personal opionion the more superior moats are luxury brands. They not only benefit from age, where plateforms like facebook have not, and allow for huge margins, but if executed corectly are just hard enough to get your hands on that it drives desire for the product even more. This is usally done through price or the number of products made.  Below I will have lists seperated into different catagories of prodcuts that do the best job of being creative, innovative, and timeless. As much as I love companies like apple and Tesla they will not be on my list. Both of these companies offer products with prominent design and inovatitive technology but   they would not be able to sell a product they release today in 20 years. Part of these companies business models is to bring great design and technology to the mass market, as CEO of LVMH group Benard Arnolt has stated 1. "Affordable Luxury- these are two words that dont go together" 2. "A good product can last forever"</p>
